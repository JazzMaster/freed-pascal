# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

As a contributor you agree to abide by these "RULES".
This IS intentionally written this way.


## Our Pledge

We pledge a harassment free environment based only on your federal rights of nondiscrimination 
because you have a religion(or not), might be LBGT (or Q), might be disabled, might be a veteran, etc etc etc. 

This is all we promise.

There is no guarantee we will not take your unicorn to the moon without asking.
This is not a pussy-footed comminuty, and the efforts to make it one are REJECTED, REBUTTED and REFUSED.

Just shut up and code.
I dont care what your cat thinks about me, or what you think about my (our) attitude.

We aim not to use binary blobs if avoidable.
You agree if using one, to give copywright and trademark references -where due- to the authors.

## Our Standards

The following is an INSTA-BAN:

* Trolling, or deeply derogatory or perverted comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private ongoing harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Political posting
* Non-FPC advertising

"Troll slaying" is perfectly legal.
We dont care which policical side you pick, even if its the wrong one. 
Express your views somewhere else.

You are HERE- TO CODE.

You are expected to grow a spine and thick skin. If you cant handle this- LEAVE NOW.

While C isnt used here, the methods can be spot on if applied in Pascal/FPC/OBJ-Pascal.
This is a FPC fork. Most FPc code should work- or at least in compatibility mode.

THis is not the place to reject code methods, it is the place to learn proper syntax.

THIS IS REAL CODE for the REAL WORLD.


People expect results and you WILL give them results. 
If caught not giving results, you will be asked to leave.
This includes a REASONABLE bug report.

I dont know wtf to do with a strack trace- never really have....so dont leave me one -
unless you want to explain it to me.


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected 
to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, 
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, 
or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem unworthy or threatening.

There is no recourse for "foaming at the mouth", however, if your life isnt being threatened 
and the text isnt perverted, the claim to remove content will probably be denied.
There is a lot of "foaming at the mouth" in FPC forums. When people do this, they dont explain the why.

We dont bend over backwards for insults. Even Linus doles them out.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual 
is representing the project or its community. 

Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, 
posting via an "official" NON-PERSONAL social media account, 
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. 

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at 
admin@freedompascal.org

The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way 
that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. 

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to 
the reporter of an incident, hoever, this does not guarantee it.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith 
may face temporary or permanent BANS as determined by members of the project's leadership.
