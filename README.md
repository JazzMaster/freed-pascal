This is Pascal.

It is Pascal Freed 

		from Private repoes- so ALL can see the code and its changes.
		from the bullshit devs- who foam at the mouth all day, refusing to fix bugs, etc.
		from mailing lists, and all that spam

It is Pascal UPDATED - 

		as FPC hasnt been in over 10 years in places.
		for those using GIT, to GIT w the program.

It is Pascal MATURE-

		It is not strictly Lazarus (UI) but old tried and TRUE methods also

It is Pascal portable-

		It not just runs on MOST hardware, it should also be modular.

Modular-

		Why should the compiler "require" routines you cant use(BUG)
		Units should extend Pascal, or be grouped like BP TPL units were.
		The "system unit" should be as small as possible.


This is PASCAL "SECURED" (RELRO,PIE,CANARIES,NX)-

		Yes, you CAN disable compiler options, but why?
		Default insecure options are "just wrong".

Pascal was spawned from Forth. 
Then it created itself -from itself.
"True Pascal" has never been compiled in C or with "gcc tools".


I was hoping it wasnt going to have to come to this- but here we are.

FPC has failed us.
Lack of "trampolines" have failed us.

Dev creedos and elite-ness have failed us.
Our code is an "ancient unmaintained mess" as a result.

It is time- to start again.
